Latency:
- speed at which messages are processed
- metric: time units eg: 1 msecs

Throughput:
- rate at which messages are processed
- metric: number of messages / time units eg: 1Mbps

Bandwith:
- Maximum limits for Throughput

Example:
Laundry system has 2 stages: Stage 1 - Washer(30 mins), Stage 2 - Dryer(60 mins)

Scenario 1:
only 1 stage processed at a time:
Latency = 30 + 60 = 90 mins
Throughput: 1 load / 90 mins
usage: when we need to process message on priority.

Scenario 2:
operate Stages in parallel
Latency = 60 + 60 = 120 mins (since both stages (Washer & Dryer) can be occupied & need to wait for slower stage(Dryer) 60 mins)
Throughput: 1 load / 60 mins
usage: when we have large number of messages.

Observation:
if all the stages are processed in a pipeline
then
1) Throughput increases
2) Latency increases
