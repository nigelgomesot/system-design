4 main types:

1) Ajax Polling:
- Initiated by client which makes requests at fixed intervals.
- Servers responds with reponse, empty repsonse or errors
- supports upto 6 parallel connections
- Cons: wasted request cycles. client & server are loaded
- e.g: Used for appication prototyping

2) Long Polling:
- enhancement to Ajax Polling
- Client needs to wait for server repsonse
- Server holds th request till new response is available or there is a timeout
- Cons: server is loaded
- e.g: used in Comet: legacy realtime applications

3) HTML 5 Web Sockets:
- communication protocol that enables a full duplex communication channel over a single TCP/IP connection
- connection established via a WebSocket handshake
- less overhead since it works on TCP/IP layer
- supports upto 1024 parallel connections
- Cons: complicated load balancing, proxy, compression techniques(since non HTTP layer protocol)
- eg: Whastapp chat

4) HTML5 Server Sent Events:
- Initiated by client but only server can send messages to client(not vice versa)
- Supporteed via javascript API EventSource
- supports upto 6 parallel connections
- eg: Stock price tracking dashboard
