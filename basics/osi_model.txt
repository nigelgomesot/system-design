OSI Model: Open System Interconnection.
- specifies layers of abstraction in a networking system.
- 7 layers

1) Physical Layer:
- lowest layer, Part of hardware layers
- data = bits
- responsible to transmit bits from 1 node to another
- eg: LAN

2) Data Link Layer:
- Part of hardware layer
- data = frames
- responsible to transmit messages via MAC addresses
- 2 sub layers: i) Logical Link Control(LLC), ii) Media Access Control(MAC)
- eg: Network Interface cards

3) Network Layer:
- Part of hardware layer
- data = packets
- responsible to transmit messages across networks
- 2 sub layers: i) Routing, ii) Logical Addressing 
- protocol: IP
- eg: Routers

4) Transport Layer:
- joins hardware & software layers
- data = segments
- responsibilities
i) at sender's side: segmentation of messages, Flow & error control of messages
ii) at receiver's side: reassembly of messages, resolves messages to correct process using port address
- 2 types of services:
i) Connection oriented: 
- 3 phases: Connection establishment, data transfer, Connection termination
- ack sent from receiver to sender
- more reliable, slower
- protocol: TCP
ii) Connection less:
- 1 phase: data transfer
- no ack sent from receiver to sender
- less reliable, faster
- protocol: UDP

5) Session Layer:
- part of software layer
- responsible to authenticate & maintain a session/connection between 2 devices
- protocol: RPC

6) Presentation Layer:
- part of software layer
- responsible for translation,encryption,decryption,compression of data.
- converts data into abstract data structure to build semantic & syntax of data
- eg: JPEG

7) Application Layer:
- highest layer, part of software layer
- Human/Application & computer interaction
- protocol: http
- eg: Web browsers
