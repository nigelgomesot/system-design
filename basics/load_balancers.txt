What is LB:
- directs reequests to dfferent servers
- helps prevent DDOS attack

How Do they work:
5 methods:
1) Round robin: send a request to server & move it to bottom of list(FIFO)
2) IP Hash: use client IP address in hashing function to determine server
3) Least connections: server which has least connections
4) Lowest response time: server with least connections & lowest response time
5) Lowest bandwidth: server traffic is measured in MBps. request is sent to server with lowest traffic.

Types:
Network: uses network layer(layer 4) to detrmine server. Fastest. falls short to ensure balanced distribution of traffic.
Application: uses application layer(layer 7) to detrmine server. most flexible to apply distribution descisions
Internal: similar to Newtork but setup up for internal infrastructure.

Variants:
Hard: Actual physical devices. expensive & rigid.
Soft: 2 types: commercial & open source. installed prior use. affordable
Virtual: different from Software since it is installed on a Hardware load balancing device on a virtual machine.
